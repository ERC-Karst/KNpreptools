# KN-Processing
Series of tools to pre-process cave graphs from speleological survey, before calculating the statistics with the python package Karstnet

The tools were initialy made for networkx graph created from Therion SQL database. 
## Graph Import tools:
- .csv files
- Therion SQL 
- nx graph


## Graph cleaning tools:
- flag edges and nodes
- remove edges based on id
- remove edges and nodes based on flags
- reconnect closeby node (based on a threshold
- transform survey leg into splay leg (ToDo)
- regroupe closeby nodes (ToDo)


## Graph export function:
- Gocad .pl
- ESRI Shapefiles (line and point)
- Therion --> Aven
- HTML (Todo)
- .csv files
- nx pickled graphs
